Creating new methods to preserve data privacy,Data sharing within DHS agencies and across components is challenging because of both privacy and security concerns. Many agencies remove sensitive but critical information from reports or documents to preserve privacy while others refrain from sharing data that could be useful to homeland security efforts due to the challenges of meeting and maintaining privacy requirements.,https://caoe.asu.edu/project/creating-new-methods-to-preserve-data-privacy/,Data analytics;Present
Guarding sensitive data with secure computations,"The use of personal information is essential for homeland security efforts, but it is also a balancing act securing this information and protecting individual privacy concerns that exist in the sharing and use of sensitive information such as surveillance images/videos, biometrics, and other individual-identifying data that is collected and generated from multiple sources across the Homeland Security Enterprise.",https://caoe.asu.edu/project/guarding-sensitive-data-with-secure-computations/,Data analytics;Present
Modeling disruptions to the Marine Transportation System,"The Marine Transportation System (MTS) is a vital part of the nation’s supply chain. The vast majority of U.S. overseas trade is carried by the MTS and its operation plays a major role in the nation’s GDP and overall prosperity. An efficient MTS reduces congestion in ports, railways, and roadways, reduces costs to consumers and business owners, and promotes homeland and national security.",https://caoe.asu.edu/project/modeling-disruptions-to-the-marine-transportation-system-mts/,Economic analysis;Present
Evaluating trustworthiness of AI-enabled systems,"The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML) and increasingly autonomous systems, has resulted in a push for technical standards that can assess the trustworthiness of these technologies. Developing standards have the potential to drive the design and development of trustworthy systems, and to more cost-effectively evaluate AI-enabled systems during technology acquisition or regulation.",https://caoe.asu.edu/project/assessing-trustworthiness-of-ai-enabled-systems/,Data analytics;Past
Improving effectiveness of procurement processes,Properly managed contractor/supplier management systems include a robust performance monitoring and improvement mechanism.
